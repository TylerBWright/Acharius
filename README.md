# Acharius
A hidden object lichen hunting game written in Lua

Acharius is a tiny hidden object game for those who are likin' the lichens! An educational minigame designed for a nonexistent school of lichenology (if only). Made with a love for all things fungi for Mushroom jam: https://itch.io/jam/mushroomm

Use the up/down/left/right directional buttons to navigate the cemetery and uncover specimens for your collection.  Leave the console open to reveal details on your finds.

Bonus: A complete "Acharius Original Soundtrack" is available for download. This zip file contains the in-game track "Rosmarinus" as well as an ENTIRE full-length album of unused music "Acharius."  That's ~50 min. of ambient music designed to harmonize with the lichen world around us.

Special Thanks:

Gabriele Maddaloni for providing the Micro Game Engine (https://thaon.itch.io/mgm), the one tool to adequately capture this tiny vision.

Erik Acharius, father of the field of lichenology

P.S.: Can you find the hidden Easter egg?
